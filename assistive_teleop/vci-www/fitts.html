        <h2>Fitt's Law Throughput Test</h2>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>This test measures your use of a virtual pointing device, such as a computer mouse. </p>
        <p class="red"><b>Before you begin: Please maximize your browser window, so that the browser is as large as possible.</b></p>
        <p>When the test begins you will see a red circle (a target). </p>
        <p>Click on the target as quickly and accurately as possible. </p>
        <p>When you click, a new target will be presented (even if you miss). </p>
        <p>Click on each new target as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>
        <p>There will be a few rounds with different size targets, different distances apart.</p>
        <p>The complete test should take less than 5 minutes.</p>
